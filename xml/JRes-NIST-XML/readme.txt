METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------


 Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
	1. Retrive list of all DOIs deposited with CrossRef
		a) HTTPS CrossRef Query https://api.crossref.org/prefixes/10.6028/works?filter=type:report
		b) convert JSON to XML using any means (example: https://www.freeformatter.com/json-to-xml-converter.html)
		c) Run a transform to pull just DOI fields into a txt file
	2. Use list of DOIs to submit a DOI-to-metadata batch query and retrive and save results as XML file. Instructions here: https://support.crossref.org/hc/en-us/articles/215007943-DOI-to-metadata-query
	

Methods for processing the data: 
	1. In Query Results XML file, Delete everything before the <body> element; don't forget to delete the end tags as well. Also delete the <crossref> tags.
	2. Remove line breaks and white spaces using any means available.


 Instrument- or software-specific information needed to interpret the data:
	 XML files can be used using any open source product


24. Describe any quality-assurance procedures performed on the data:
	Data is reviewed for errors/duplications. Since errors originated in CrossRef DOI deposits, updates to DOI metadata are deposited with CrossRef and data is retrived again through DOI-to-metadata queries.


People involved with sample collection, processing, analysis and/or submission:
	NIST Research Library employees are responsible for depositing metadata with Crossref, collecting metadata for analysis, and processing it for public consumption.
