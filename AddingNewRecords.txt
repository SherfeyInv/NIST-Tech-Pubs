Steps to adding records to TechPubs2HTML

1. Get JSON file of all DOIs deposited since you last added to the records (date is inclusive)
	JSON file from CrossRef API HTTP query: https://api.crossref.org/prefixes/10.6028/works?filter=type:report,from-deposit-date:YYYY-MM-DD

2. Parse out DOIs (may need to open JSON file in OXYGEN to read it better)

3. Submit a DOI query to CrossRef
	Sign in to CrossRed admin
	Go here: https://doi.crossref.org/servlet/submissionAdmin?sf=doiQuery
	Paste in DOIs
	Choose format UNIXSD
	Hit Submit

5. Make sure the TechPubs2HTML OXYGEN Project is Open

6. Copy results from #3 to a new XML file in OXYGEN

7. Delete everything before the <body> element

8. Do a Find and Delete (or Find/replace with nothing) of this entire element:        

<crossref xmlns="http://www.crossref.org/xschema/1.1" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.crossref.org/xschema/1.1 http://doi.crossref.org/schemas/unixref1.1.xsd">

Don't forget to delete the end as well: </crossref>

9. save XML file in the TechPubs2HTML/XML folder
	use file naming structure: from-deposit-date:YYYY-MM-DD.xml

10. Run the AllRecords2QueryKey transformation scenario on this file.

11. Copy everything between the <body> elements from this new -querykeyresult.xml file to before the </body> element at the end of allrecords-querykeyresult.xml

12. Save file allrecords-querykeyresult.xml and run the AllRecords2HTML-advanced transformation scenario to get the updated HTML page
