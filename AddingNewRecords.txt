Steps to adding records to TechPubs2HTML

1. Get list of DOIs deposited since you last added to allrecords XML file. Few ways to get DOIs:

	(a) - easier if just doing the past few days
	Sign into CrossRef admin
	Go here: https://doi.crossref.org/servlet/submissionAdmin
	Enter date range into "Recieved Date" start/end fields
	Click on the submission IDs to get the submitted DOI information (either in the Message box or you can click on the 			content link to see what was submitted)

	(b) - easier if a date range that is longer than 1 week
	Get JSON from CrossRef API HTTP query: https://api.crossref.org/prefixes/10.6028/works?filter=type:report,from-deposit-		date:YYYY-MM-DD
	convert JSON to XML (https://www.freeformatter.com/json-to-xml-converter.html)
	Save XML file as DOILIST-from-deposit-date:YYYY-MM-DD-to-YYY-MM-DD.XML	
	Run the DOIList Transform on the file to get a text list


2. Use list of DOIs to submit a DOI query to CrossRef to get a UNIXSD XML file
	Sign in to CrossRed admin
	Go here: https://doi.crossref.org/servlet/submissionAdmin?sf=doiQuery
	Paste in DOIs
	Choose format UNIXSD
	Hit Submit

3. Make sure the TechPubs2HTML OXYGEN Project is Open

4. Copy results from #2 to a new XML file in OXYGEN

5. Delete everything before the <body> element

6. Do a Find and Delete (or Find/replace with nothing) of this entire element:        

	<crossref xmlns="http://www.crossref.org/xschema/1.1" xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.crossref.org/xschema/1.1 	http://doi.crossref.org/schemas/unixref1.1.xsd">

	Don't forget to delete the end as well: </crossref>

7. save XML file in the TechPubs2HTML/XML folder
	use file naming structure: from-deposit-date:YYYY-MM-DD-to-YYY-MM-DD.xml (the "to" date is the date you ran the query. You 	don't have to incldue the second date in the query because it calculates automatically).

8. Run the AllRecords2QueryKey transformation scenario on this file.

9. Run the AllRecords2TextStep1 transformation on the new file.

10. Copy everything between the <body> elements from this new -querykeyresult.xml file to before the </body> element at the end of allrecords-querykeyresult.xml

11. Save file allrecords-querykeyresult.xml and run the AllRecords2HTML-advanced transformation scenario to get the updated HTML page
